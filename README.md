## Image Archive

The **Image Archive** is a directory within the Nábytek Martyn repository. As the name suggests, it's an archive housing
all past and potential future images related to Nábytek Martyn's website, not to be confused with the current, optimized
images located in the `/img/` directory. However, within the `/img-fullsize/` directory, you will find the identical
images in their original, unoptimized quality.

The structure and purpose of the directories within the image archive are as follows:

- `/img-archive/banners`: Contains an archive of main banners previously used across different pages on the website.

- `/img-archive/clients`: Contains an archive of images related to our valued clients.

- `/img-archive/favicon`: Contains an archive of previously used favicons.

- `/img-archive/icons-fullsize`: Contains full-sized versions of all product category icons, including those not
  currently in use.

- `/img-archive/icons-resized`: Contains an archive of resized versions of product category icons.

- `/img-archive/logos`: Contains an archive of previous logos.

- `/img-archive/our-products`: Contains an archive of edited (brightened) product images, including those not currently
  in use.

- `/img-archive/our-work-fullsize`: Contains full-sized images of all projects completed by Nábytek Martyn, including
  those not currently displayed on the website.

- `/img-archive/our-work-resized`: Contains an archive of old, resized images of projects completed by Nábytek Martyn.

- `/img-archive/partner-logos`: Contains an archive of logos from our business partners and associates.
